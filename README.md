## About the project
The project is a task manager that is accessed through logging in and is navigated through easy to read menu options. 

The program allows the user to:
- view tasks, either their own or all tasks logged in the system
- edit the tasks due date or assigned user
- create a new task
- register a new user

The project was built from a simpler version of a task manager that was refactored to extend the functionality.

## Built with
VSCode and Python


## How to navigate the program

First you will need to log in to access the manager

![loginandmenu](https://github.com/amykha/finalCapstone/assets/152326238/f3cdf98c-5622-4483-8900-982293232571)

After log in is successful the menu will appear.


### Register a user

![newuser](https://github.com/amykha/finalCapstone/assets/152326238/19bb4ba0-425d-465d-aecc-49b0c34d0dc6)

The program will prompt the user to provide a username for the new user, plus a new password and a confirmation.

If the user tries choosing a username that already exists, the bellow error message will appear:

Similarly, if the passwords don't match the program will produce this error message:

![passwordmatch](https://github.com/amykha/finalCapstone/assets/152326238/db5d3f02-8884-47ce-95f4-56e863fa7cd2)


### Add a new task

### View my tasks

This menu option will display the tasks only assigned to the currently logged in user where they are able to manage the tasks themselves.
